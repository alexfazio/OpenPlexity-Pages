## Introducing OpenPlexity Pages

OpenPlexity Pages serves as an open-source alternative to Perplexity Pages, with the aim of transforming your research into visually appealing, comprehensive content.
Although the system is not capable of producing publication-ready articles, which often necessitate a substantial number of revisions, experienced editors may find it beneficial during their initial writing phase.

## What sets OpenPlexity apart?

- **Open Source**: Unlike Perplexity Pages, OpenPlexity Pages is fully open source, allowing for community contributions and customizations.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Your data stays with you. OpenPlexity Pages runs locally, ensuring your research and content remain private.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the tone of your content to resonate with your target audience, from general readers to subject matter experts.
- **Adaptable**: Easily modify the structure of your articles—add, rearrange, or remove sections to best suit your material.
- **Visual**: Enhance your articles with AI-generated visuals or integrate your own images.

## Features That Matter

- **Local LLM Support (Coming soon!)**: Harness the power of Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama for content generation.
- **Seamless Creation**: Transform your research into well-structured, beautifully formatted articles with ease.
- **Always Current**: Unlike static embedding-based tools, OpenPlexity Pages uses real-time search results, ensuring your content is up-to-date.

## A Tool for Everyone

OpenPlexity Pages empowers creators in any field to share knowledge:

- **Educators**: Develop comprehensive study guides, breaking down complex topics into digestible content.
- **Researchers**: Create detailed reports on your findings, making your work more accessible.
- **Hobbyists**: Share your passions by creating engaging guides that inspire others.
- **Content Creators**: Produce well-researched, visually appealing articles on any topic.
